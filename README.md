### Description

How about 30 image effects and a histogram function using Getpixel, Setpixel and BitBlt API. I know im not the first one to submit effects/filters.. but this one is very easy to understand. It is not as fast as some others but it can easily be modified. Effect list: Add noise, Pixelize, Black And White, Grayscale, Colorize, Find edges (horizontal and vertical), Find Edges b/w (horizontal and vertical), 3D Grid, 3D Effect, Lightness, Darkness, Modern Art, Strange, Multiply colors, Divide colors, Lighten, Darken, Invert, Smart Noise, Fog, Blur (horizontal and vertical) and some mirror/flip effects. You can also save your processed images.

(If you like the 3D effect please check out my heightmap code that is more advanced)
